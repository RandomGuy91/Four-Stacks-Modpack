# Four-Stacks-Modpack
Files for the Four Stacks Modpack
Hey guys! Thanks for choosing my pack, I spent a good 6 months working on it in my free time. 
The normal files are here, so copy all the text in the options.txt file into your existing one in your .minecraft folder. 
Only do this AFTER you have loaded the game with all mods and configs.
Speaking of which, copy all the files in mods 1, and put them in your mods folder, then do the same for mods 2 and mods 3.
The reason I can't do them in one big folder, is because GitHub has an upload limit of 100 files (and I don't know how to move files)
Repeat line 6 for all configs (not defaultconfig)
Then copy all files and folders in defaultconfigs to your folder in your .minecraft folder
If you have any questions, post them on the Curseforge page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/four-stacks-modpack
Enjoy!
